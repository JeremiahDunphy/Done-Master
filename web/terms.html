    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-title">ARTICLE I. GENERAL ACCEPTANCE AND GOVERNING AGREEMENT</div>
        <h3>1.1 Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>By accessing, browsing, registering for an account, or otherwise utilizing the Done platform, including all
            associated websites, applications, and services (collectively, "the Platform"), you, the user ("User,"
            "Client," or "Provider"), acknowledge that you have read, understood, and irrevocably agree to be bound by
            these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"), as well as our Privacy Policy, and any other policies or guidelines
            referenced herein. If you do not agree to the entirety of these Terms, you are explicitly prohibited from
            using the Platform and must cease use immediately.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Modifications</h3>
        <p>Done reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will
            provide notice of material changes through the Platform or via email. By continuing to access or use the
            Platform after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. The date of the
            last revision will be indicated at the top of this document.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Eligibility</h3>
        <p>The Platform is intended solely for Users who are 18 years of age or older. Any access to or use of the
            Platform by anyone under 18 is expressly unauthorized and in violation of these Terms. By using the
            Platform, you represent and warrant that you are 18 years or older.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-title">ARTICLE II. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE AND PLATFORM ROLE</div>
        <h3>2.1 Service Definition</h3>
        <p>The Platform operates as a neutral gig marketplace designed exclusively to facilitate the connection between
            Clients seeking specific, temporary services ("Jobs") and Providers offering professional services ("Gigs").
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Platform as Facilitator</h3>
        <p>Done is not an employer, agent, or representative of either Clients or Providers. Done's role is strictly
            limited to providing the technology infrastructure for posting, application, communication, and payment
            processing. Done does not supervise, direct, or control the work performed by Providers, nor does it
            guarantee the quality, suitability, or legality of the Jobs or Gigs offered. Users expressly acknowledge and
            agree that Done is not a party to any agreement or contract entered into between the Client and the
            Provider.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-title">ARTICLE III. FINANCIAL TERMS AND FEES</div>
        <h3>3.1 Platform Transaction Fee</h3>
        <p>Done shall charge a service fee ("Transaction Fee") equal to ten percent (10%) of the total agreed-upon
            monetary value for all completed transactions facilitated through the Platform. This fee is non-negotiable
            and is automatically calculated and deducted from the payment remitted to the Provider.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Payment Processing</h3>
        <p>All payments for services rendered must be processed exclusively through the Platform's designated payment
            system. Any attempts to circumvent the Platform's payment system to avoid the Transaction Fee are a material
            breach of these Terms and will result in immediate account suspension and potential legal action.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Funding and Release</h3>
        <p>Clients must pre-fund the full agreed-upon amount for a Job into an escrow or holding account before the
            Provider commences work. Funds will be held until the Client provides explicit approval of job completion.
            Providers will be paid upon Client approval, less the 10% Transaction Fee.</p>

        <h3>3.4 Non-Refundable Fees</h3>
        <p>All Platform fees (the 10% Transaction Fee) are non-refundable, except in cases where Done determines, at its
            sole discretion, that the Provider failed to render any portion of the service whatsoever.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <div class="article-title">ARTICLE IV. USER ACCOUNTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</div>
        <h3>4.1 Account Security</h3>
        <p>Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account credentials, including
            passwords. You agree to notify Done immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. Done will not be

            <li>Not require the Provider to perform any illegal, unethical, or dangerous activities.</li>

            <li>Bear sole responsibility for all federal, state, and local taxes, insurance, and other liabilities
                associated with their provision of services as an independent contractor.</li>

        <p>By posting, uploading, or displaying any content (including text, images, reviews, and portfolio items) on
            the Platform ("User Content"), you grant Done a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable,
            worldwide license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, and display such User Content in connection with

        <h3>5.3 Work Product</h3>

            any intellectual property rights arising from the work product created under a Job are automatically
            assigned to the Client upon final payment. Done claims no ownership rights over the intellectual property
            created between Users.</p>
